/**
 * TestCouncilMember
 *
 * This JUnit test simulates a 9-member Paxos cluster under ideal conditions.
 * Each CouncilMember runs in its own thread with a reliable network profile.
 *
 * Scenario 1:
 *   - 9 members: M1â€“M9
 *   - All network profiles = reliable
 *   - M1 proposes itself ("M1") as Council President
 * Expected outcome:
 *   - Consensus is reached and printed as:
 *     "CONSENSUS: M1 has been elected Council President!"
